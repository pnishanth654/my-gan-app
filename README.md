This project uses a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to generate realistic clothing item images based on user-selected labels (e.g., T-shirt, Shoe, Bag). Users can interactively choose a class, and the model generates a corresponding fashion item.
